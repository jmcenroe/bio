            <p>I haven't always been a developer, but I have always had a curious mind, constantly wondering about the inner workings of things and why they work the way they do. I started by playing around on the internet, like many people. Then that same curiosity sparked and I jumped into web development.</p>

            <p>Before becoming a web developer, I worked in regular office jobs for 10 years. The need to get creative and understand the technology I use daily became too strong to ignore. I decided I needed a change. I started by recreating simple mockups of web pages I found. The more I practiced coding as a hobby, the more fun (and frustrating) it became. After many attempts to teach myself to code, I decided to enroll in a coding bootcamp.</p> 

            <p>There, I have learned many technologies necessary for full stack web development. With these skills, I am able to put both thoughts and functionality together in a way that makes intuitive sense for users and for other developers alike.</p>
